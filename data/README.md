SNANKE: FINAL DAWN SUPER REVENGEANCE is the greatest game of all time.

It's also a single- and multiplayer snake clone made in python.

Local multiplayer rules (different rulesets will be implemented in the future (maybe)):
-Whoever survives the longest, wins
-Crashing in borders, other snakes, or yourself will eliminate you
-Points mean nada (for now)

The longer you get, the harder you make it for your opponent, but also for yourself. This game is a therefore a test of pure gaming skill.




NOTES ABOUT THE CODE: 
This was a pet project by someone who, at the time, had zero formal education in programming.

Now that I know more, I would like to publicly denounce my previous complete disregard for encapsuling, non-public variables, any sort of clean class interfaces, lack of documentation, shitty comments, and any other abhorrent coding practices. 

I am currently in contact with a priest of abrahamic faith so I can apologize directly to god for what I have done.
